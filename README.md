# Friday Night Funkin' - Psych Engine Organized

![](https://github.com/SquidBowl/PE-0.7.2-ORGANIZED/blob/main/art/banner.png)

A fork of [Psych Engine](https://github.com/ShadowMario/) based off 0.7.3.

You guys like 0.7.3? Well, I do! Do you hate having to remove all the unneeded files? Well, I do too. So I did something about it! I made a Psych Fork that removes and cleans any and all unneeded assets, classes, and files! Note, this fork is made for my use in mind, and while can be used by others, it might not cater to everyone!

## Changes
- Removed unneeded Stage classes
- Ran all images through oxipng for optimal image quality and performance
- Deleted any unneeded files/assets
- Repathed folders to keep things organized
- Fixed the slow camera movement in PlayState, MainMenuState, and GameOverSubstate
- Reduced Deprecation Warnings
- Removed unneeded files in Art folder in Root folder
- Organized menu folders/Uncluttered shared folder

## Installation:
* Inside the root folder is another folder named "setup". If you struggle to compile, just run the .BAT file.
* In addition to what's above, you can run ``haxelib run hmm install`` if all you want is the dependencies.
