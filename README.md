# Friday Night Funkin' - Psych Engine Organized

![](https://github.com/SquidBowl/PE-0.7.2-ORGANIZED/blob/main/art/banner.png)

A fork of [Psych Engine](https://github.com/ShadowMario/) based off 0.7.2 Experimental Branch that keeps modding and organization in mind. 

You guys like 0.7.2? Well, I do! Do you hate having to remove all the shit unneeded files? Well, I do too. So I did something about it! I made a Psych Fork that removes and cleans any and all unneeded assets, classes, and files!

## Changes
- Removed unneeded Stage classes
- Ran all images through oxipng for optimal image quality and performance
- Deleted any unneeded files/assets
- Repathed folders to keep things organized
- Fixed the slow camera movement in PlayState + MainMenuState
- Added a Customizable FPS/MEM Counter
- Reduced Deprecation Warnings
- Removed unneeded files in Art folder in Root folder
- Toggleable Videos option to reduce folder size
- Organized menu folders/Uncluttered shared folder
- Setup hmm/.BAT file(s)

## Installation:
* Inside the root folder is another folder named "setup". If you struggle to compile, just run the .BAT file.
* In addition to what's above, you can run ``haxelib run hmm install`` if all you want is the dependencies.
